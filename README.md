# DocExpress
**Introduction**
Doc Express, as we have vision, will be an online, remotely available, real-time file tracking and paperwork history maintenance system with an operational database and intuitive front-end for the user. We aim to develop an android and web application for this purpose. It will provide multiple operations like the history of physical documents, tracking an ongoing paperwork in an institution, registering complaints, and much more we aim to innovate during this project.
Doc Express will help in tracking the movement of official manual applications. It enables the users to maintain a consistent watch over the movement of various important official applications. It will also be used to search the documents. It was felt that a system is required to monitor the movement of the applications also check the statues of applications whether they are approved, rejected or closed etc.
To fulfill the requirement, a thorough study was conducted of the existing Fast University’s system. It was decided that the system should be a lightweight application requiring minimal inputs and user- friendly interface. The system has been designed in such a manner that the controlling officer of an organization/division/section can view the tracking of the documents or application and could take appropriate decisions. This has been achieved by putting rigorous efforts while designing of the database for the application.

**Problem Statement**
The existing record management system in our government offices is paper based. Thousands of records are being stored into a register with a track number in which a particular document is saved. There are a lot of major problems that are being faced because of this paper based system. The problems are mentioned as following:

● Documents that are being stored have privacy issues as anyone in the department has access. Any unauthorized person can access the file of any particular person which can be misused and altered.

● Most of the time the files are lost or not delivered on time. At that point no one is ready to accept the mistake and take the blame.

● Searching the records in the register is a very difficult and time consuming task as there are multiple registers being used to store records.

● Fatigue increases as there are long lines of customers waiting for their turn. So remaining at the desk for the whole day is a difficult task.

● Tracking documents is difficult as the file has to go through many departments before it reaches its destination.


**Project Scope**
Doc express is basically an Android application that will be helping organization in organize records and files and requests in a well-organized way. It will improve the working efficiency of the office. With this application we will easily be able to track the documents. We will also be able to generate reports so we can see the progress of the department.
